    Summer in Chicago, ayy, yeah
    Only here about a day, yeah
    Looking out the sunroof
    I ain't really trippin', but I'm hoping that you come through, yeah
    She told me that she tryna save up
    Coming from Milwaukee, she gon' make her way up
    Said she living single, she don't need no fake love
    If we keep it honest we don't need a label
    Love is everything and everything is love, yeah
    Why the pressure when you focused and you young, yeah?
    But I'm hoping that one day it could be something
    She deserve 100 and these niggas give her nothing
