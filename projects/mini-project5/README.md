This is a chrome extension that I want to send to one of my best friends who
always forget to drink water.

By clicking the buttons, users could set the alarm. For instance, if you want to remind yourself to drink a cup of water after 15 minutes, you could click the "15 minutes" button; there will be a popup message show up on the screen after 15 minutes.

For testing, you could click the first button,"sample second", to trigger a popup message instantly.
