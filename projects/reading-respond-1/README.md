The boundaries between virtual identities and biological identities are becoming more and more blurry. It seems to be impossible for people who are living in this generation to have the capability to escape from living in both virtual and actual world. We have social media accounts to post what we want to share; we have lots of platforms that enable us to text people using the internet and our virtual avatar.

But it is not to say that they are the same; the virtual and the actual identities are separated from each other. In the article, the author mentions that people “lie” about age, sex, or location. Just like what Julie did: she described herself as an elderly disable women, but actually she was a “middle-age male psychiatrist. ” This example substantiate that virtual and actual are separated, and these two identities could be totally different from each other if people want to.

However,  the author use examples to explain that what’s happening in virtual world can cause actual hurts to the biological body; maybe the virtual environment is just an actual environment in a different depth. So I think the point here is that we can own both virtual and biological identities at the same time, but we should not lie and do harm to other people.
