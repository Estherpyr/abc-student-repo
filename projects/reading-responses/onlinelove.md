For many people nowadays, the internet is part of the reality.  It is hard to force a people to live “offline” even for a day, especially for the young generation, who are called ‘digital native’ John Palfrey and Urs Gasser. One important component in our lives is intimacy. We might not be aware of this but the truth is our relationships are getting more and more complex due to this “mixed situation” —— our real lives and online lives are integrated; we somehow depend on social media platforms which enable us to maintain long distance relationships and expand our social circle.

There are many ways to think of online intimacy. Because our identities on the internet are not fully the same with their counterparts in the real life, there are, indeed, some burdens that people can’t overcome. One example in Gene McHugh’s article “The Context of the Digital: A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships”, Hirsch and Jobe who knew each other online were afraid of meeting in physical space, because there is a fear that “by dramatically switching contexts the thrill of the relationship that they developed would snap. ” Therefore, online love is at the very least real in some circumstances. However, people can’t deny the importance of some parts of the online love nowadays. Just like what Claire L. Evans conveys in his article, If someone breaks up nowadays, he or she not merely needs to break up in the physical world, but also needs to delete their posts that are related with this relationship on the internet and so on.
