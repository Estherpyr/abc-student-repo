As for the RMB city that was created by Cao Fei, she states that “it mixes the different elements of China.” It’s a combination of different parts of China, which is virtual yet realistic from my point of view. I think it’s like a avatar of China as a whole, because we could see not merely different cities in this project, but also citizens. They are inalienable for China in the developing process.

As for Eva and Franco Mattes’s projects, it’s more like a “pioneer” and the imagination toward how the world could be. At that time, social media are not prevailing. People are not familiar with sharing their own lives on the platforms. However, they successfully demonstrated how digital tools could be used to share intimate details of one’s life. Computers are the platforms upon which our daily lives and interpersonal relationships play out. This project enables people to see their own computers on the website, and it is also helping people to realize that the information moved on computer networks was leading not only to new routes of circulation for art and ideas, but also to unprecedented record collection by governments and corporation.
