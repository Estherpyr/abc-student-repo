For the early net arts, content could not be separated from the context within which was performed. Even though the assertion from Bill Gates is “content is king”, in the web art world, context is king.  And among the examples, I picked Samsung, because it is a famous company from South Korea, which makes me wonder “what kind of art work could it be”. This project needs Adobe Flash Player in order to run; the text on the page change perfectly with the beat of music, which is aesthetically pleasing. However, there’s no interactivity in this project. But the total lost of interaction made me feel that I was immersed myself in the art piece. I thought it was the part that the artist need to improve, but after realizing the history between Samsung and South Koreans, I can feel the ironic behind the project. The content that are displayed are seem to be positive and supportive toward Samsung, such as “I believe Samsung will help me get over being dead”, the real context that YHCHI was trying to express is so satirical. After reading the article, I know that Samsung controlled people in South Korea, and it put all the financial burdens on people, which harmed people’s lives so much. People hated Samsung, yet they had to rely on it, for it controlled the economy of their country. At first, I thought that the artwork is not interactive at all. However, I realize that even this part of the work, which seems to be an insufficiency, is also implying the context: people have no power to control themselves.
