I totally agree with what Lialina is expressing in her articles. Just like she mentions that “closing styles come back into fashion so do web design,” I could really find lots of traces that represent the past nowadays on the internet. While reading the articles, the glittery graphics reminds me of the Chinese Valentines’ day advertisement that Balenciaga made for Chinese consumers. Strictly speaking, even though it is not a web design, and this design was so controversy that some said Balenciaga thought Chinese consumers have no fashion sense, it still shows that the “retro” styles reminds people of the early days and people regard a specific style as the symbol of a generation.

There’s no right or wrong about which style is the one that we should keep. In my opinion, I think Lialina’s research is trying to make people realize that we shouldn’t make the old disappear. I grow up with the “modern” web environment and I need to admit that I’ve never use a website like she shows in her articles. However, I think they are aesthetically appealing; maybe they reminds me of the glittery stickers that I collected when I was young, or the first computer game that I played on the website. These consist of good old days.
